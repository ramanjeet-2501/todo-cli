# todo-cli
📝 Console-Based To-Do List App (todo.py)
This is a simple command-line To-Do List manager built with Python. It allows users to:

✅ View current tasks

➕ Add new tasks

🗑️ Remove tasks by number

💾 Store tasks persistently in a tasks.txt file using Python’s open() function

The app uses lists to manage tasks in memory and reads/writes to a text file so tasks are saved even after exiting the program.
